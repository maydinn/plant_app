African Violet,LIGHT,"Your African violet loves bright indirect sunlight. Try and place it somewhere that gets loads of daylight, but not somewhere the sun is directly beating down on it. Near an eastern window or a few feet back from a southern window are ideal spots for this plant. Yellowing leaves and a lack of blooms can mean not enough light, while sunburnt, bleached leaves point to too much light. If you are worried you do not have a spot with enough light, try aGrow Light."
African Violet,WATER,"Waterwhen the soil volume is 25% dry. This plant likes to be kept moist but does not like to sit in soggy soil. Avoid getting the leaves wet, and the bottom-watering method is recommended. Place your plant in a sink filled with 2-4″ of water. Leave the plant to soak for up to 45 minutes. Test the top of the soil for moisture. If it still feels dry water a little from the top. When your plant’s soil is evenly damp, drain the sink/tub and allow the plant to rest while it drains thoroughly."
